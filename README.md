# Integrated Human Resource Management System (HRMS)

This project is an **Integrated Human Resource Management System (HRMS)** designed to support core human resource operations within an organization.

The system aims to centralize employee management, leave and attendance tracking, payroll processing, performance management, and administrative workflows in a single platform. It is built using a **decoupled architecture**, with a web-based frontend and a backend API, allowing scalability, flexibility, and on-premise deployment.

The HRMS is intended for **internal organizational use** and supports role-based access for administrators, HR managers, and employees. The project is being developed incrementally, starting with system architecture, user interface, and core modules, with full backend integration planned as development progresses.
